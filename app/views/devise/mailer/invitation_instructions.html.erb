To make sure we can meet the needs of people taking part, we're managing this stage of the Beta program in a contained way.

experiment and hopefully, have fun using Lelylan.

It would be great if you could provide us with some more information about how you would like to use Lelylan. In this way
we can determine the best way to get you involved. We are seeking for new collaborations, but more specifically weâ€™re
interested in understanding whether you want to use Lelylan do define user interaction solutions or to connect physical
devices.
